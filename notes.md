# Task 1 - REGEX 

Using regular expressions to interpret and manipulate historical text. 

- Installing curl to retrieve a url and output to txt file. 
-- This actually did not work, as it was shown in the discord. Despite Dr. Graham's reccomendations, verifying that curl was installed correctly served no purpose. As seen below

# Task 2 - API's

  Getting material out of an API 
  
  The concept of API's was already very familiar to me. 

 - As an aside, I wrote a program with a friend back in highschool using Java which parses a JSON API in order to rename files! 
        - More detail on this can be found in my reflection 


# Task 3 - OCR 
 
 - Installing R was hard to do but thanks to discord, I was able to go back and find where I can download the file to install it. 
 - R is VERY unintuitive. took me forever to find the image I saved, so instead, I just saved the image to work with in the default folder RStudio wanted to search in. 
 - The looping of the files never worked. It seemed straightforward but the output never got generated. 
        - I figured it was time I threw in the towel and summed up my learnings.
        - It's very hard to make sure the code actually succesfully compiles. There's no indication other than this little > which frustrated me when it never showed up. 


# Summary 

This week's exercises did not pose as much of a complicated mind boggling challenge as much as it did software compatibility. The frsutrations many students experienced and communicated in Discord were felt among the peers and it goes to show that digitization isn't as easy as we may think. 

Of course, troubleshooting is the nature in the tech world and this week taught me more about that than anything else!
