# 1. Initial thoughts
 - Onto the third week, I had promised that I would try not to fall behind and pick up better work habits that proved to work in week 2. This week made it hard to implement those improvements as I struggled through the first half of the week. It was content heavy, with lots of introduction to new tools as well as documentation on how to use such tools. And required careful attention to detail, as I quickly noticed after repeatedly making the same mistakes, only to realize I had read past the answer (doh!). 
 - The REGEX was a fun exercise, mainly to see the transformative effects of our expressions. I had also recalled working on a similar exercise in Java a long time ago with a friend of min on how to parse through an API using regular expressions to filter data into a file that is more easily readible by a code we had written. Alas, that knowledge seemed to be in the back of my mind and I took it back to the drawing board this week.
 - Once I had finished the REGEX, things seemed to follow a positive trend, which only reinforces time and time again that things don't always work the first time, and must be kept for a later date. 
 
 # 2. Considerations 
 
 - This week, I had a chance to reflect on the importance of the triage of information is. Without these tools learned, digital historians would be working around the clock only to make a handwritting mistake and have to start over. 
  - These digital tools help increase the flow of information as it becomes more accessible and in the hands of specialists who are able to appropriately filter the informations using tools like OpenRefine. 
  - The tools however, are not God's work. The historians work to ensure the information is properly documented to some extent so that these tools work better. As we say in programming "garbage in, garbage out". We must ensure that the data we are feeding our tools is written in the same "language" our machines use, so to speak.
- As students, these tools can also serve as organizational tools in many other workloads. For instance, it was mentioned by Dr. Graham that biologists can make use of these tools, albeit they do come with cavieats as these tools often try to make sense of the terminology of the content. (they often do a bad job apparently) 
 - Nonetheless, showing your work can be a powerful thing, if displayed properly. No one will spend more time than they need looking through work if it's a mess of mumbo jumbo. But by using these tools, we can organize the mumbo jumbo to present it in ways that are clearer than ever. 
 
 # 3. Going forward 
 
 ### Phew
 
As Dr. Graham would say... 
  
  - Admittedly, I fell behind this week. A lot of the work got to my head in an especially difficult time and I was not able to prioritize what I needed to do. This led to me losing the motivation I gained in the last week of work. However, this does not mean i've given up. 
   - The work was completed regardless of these circumstances as I really did want to learn about these tools, more specifically regex. 
 - It was also nice to be able to incorporate some quality of life improvements on the github this week such as embedding my pictures in the notes directly, and not using a zip to upload my work folder (less downloading to your device). 
 - I think going forward, it's important to start the work as early as possible, to allow for these mistakes to happen and have time to fix them without falling behind. 
  - External factors can't be helped but it's what you make of them that counts. This week, I wasn't so fortunate to experience that wisdom. 
 - Lastly, I want to reflect upon the course overall as i've completed the halfway mark. 
  - So far, we've learned how to pull data from the web and save it to our devices, use software to translate data pulled from images into text and the subsequent filtering, clustering and tidying up of this data in order to represent it visually. 
  - These tools all work complimentary to eachother, which is especially what I like about this course. It has a flow that keeps the student following the course as if it were a novel. Each week has a narrative, and the tasks build upon eachother all while moving us into uncharted territory. 
  - These small things, when stringed together and pulled off correctly, are ever so satisfying and keep my engagement in the course! 
 
 # Done!
